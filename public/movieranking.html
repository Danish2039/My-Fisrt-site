    <p>
      In My Hero Academia: World Heroes’ Mission, a mysterious terrorist group
      called the Humanize are introduced. They strongly believe in the "Quirk
      Singularity Doomsday Theory." The theory states that as future generations
      continue to be mixed with the Quirk genes, the power it holds will lead to
      humanity’s demise. Furthermore, Humanize believes that Quirks are a
      disease, and so, they plan to “cleanse the world” by exterminating anyone
      who has one. Humanize planted "Ideo Trigger Bombs" in various countries,
      and these explosives are said to make a Quirk-user lose control of their
      Quirk, leading to mass destruction. To save and protect everyone,
      Pro-Heroes from around the world, and the U.A. Academy heroes-in-training,
      unite to thwart the efforts of the mysterious group.

    <h3>5.Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Movie</h3>
    <p>
      Yuuta Okkotsu is haunted. Ever since his childhood friend Rika died in a
      traffic accident, her ghost has stuck with him. But her spirit does not
      appear as the sweet girl Yuuta once knew. Instead, she manifests as a
      monstrous and powerful entity who fiercely protects him. Unable to control
      Rika's violent behavior, Yuuta is helpless to stop the bloodshed that
      follows from her brutal vengeance. As a result, when apprehended by
      "Jujutsu" sorcerers—the secret guardians of the world, trained to combat
      forces like Rika—Yuuta wishes to be completely isolated so that no one
      else can get hurt. Yet his apprehender, the master sorcerer Satoru Gojou,
      has different plans for him: he will join Jujutsu High School and learn to
      control Rika in order to help people. Now a first-year at this school,
      Yuuta starts to learn Jujutsu arts and combat malignant beings. Alongside
      his new classmates Maki Zenin, a Jujutsu weapons expert; Toge Inumaki, a
      spellcaster who uses his words as weapons; and Panda, a seemingly walking
      and talking panda bear, Yuuta begins to find his place in the world and,
      for once, to feel comfortable with his abilities. However, as his training
      progresses, Yuuta comes to learn that the dangers of the Jujutsu world go
      far beyond that of wicked spirits.
